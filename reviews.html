            Ben receives a gift from an old friend. When he opens the box, there is just total darkness with no floor.
            The card says, to never let the box out of his sight. When Ben and his girlfriend Rachel look away, to find
            out what would happen, a head comes out of the box. Ben, wanting to get answers on why his friend would gift
            him something like that, leaves to talk to his friend, while Rachel stays and watches the box. After talking
            to his friend Shaun, Ben finds out that only his eyes can prevent the man in the box from moving, which
            means that Rachel was in great danger. After speeding home, Ben can’t find Rachel, but he finds the man from
            the box. Unfortunately, there seem to be more people Ben has to keep in his sight to stop them from moving,
            but how can you look at two things in different locations at the same time?

            after her big loss, her best friend Hunter comes to town again. To take Becky’s mind off of things a little

            Shaun received a book from his dying grandmother followed by the words “when she's gone, "she" will protect
            him, just as she always has”. In a flashback, we learn, that Shaun has previously fallen victim to a bully
            named Kris. One day, when Shaun tries to find the symbol in the forest his grandmother has told him to look
            out for, Kris appears and screams at him. Shaun who now is driven by panic, reads an incantation of the book
            out loud and “she”, the creature his grandmother told him would protect him, appears and brings the bullying
            to a final end.

            Leena looks like a child but is actually 31 years old. That is because of a condition called
            hypopituitarism, which prevents her body from aging. She is a patient in an Estonian psychiatric clinic. One
            day Leena manages to lure a guard into her cell, and after murdering him, she steals his security card to
            escape. After the escape, she takes on the identity of a 4-year-long missing child from Amerika called
            Esther. Since she looks quite like what Esther would look like now, and considering the parents haven’t seen
            their daughter in 4 years, they take her in and don’t realize that it isn’t their daughter who is living in
            their house. Once a police officer checks if Esther’s fingerprints from 4 years ago match those from now
            because he grew suspicion about Leena, he is shocked to find out that they don’t match at all. Leena is
            forced to get rid of the police officer, who could blow her cover. Little did she know that her “Mother”
            knew about her lies, too, and she finds herself threatened by her. But since the mother didn’t want to hurt
            her husband with yet another disappearance, they worked out an agreement. Leena would go on to pretend to be
            Esther, and therefore the mother wouldn’t send her back to WHAT. But Leena was not the only one who had to
            hide something…
