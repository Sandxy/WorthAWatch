                        <h4>About the movie</h4>
                        <!--Description + Thoughts-->
                        <p>The rules are simple: if you watch the tape, you will die in seven days. Katy, her boyfriends
                            and two of their friends decided to watch the tape regardless, because they didn&rsquo;t
                            take it seriously. After seven days, every single one of them was dead. Katy&rsquo;s
                            grieving mother couldn&rsquo;t live with the prognosis of the doctors, that her little
                            girl&rsquo;s heart just stopped, so she asked her sister Rachel, a journalist, to find out
                            what really happened to her daughter. After some questioning and investigating, Rachel comes
                            across the tape and decides to watch it herself. She promptly regrets that decision and
                            scaredly realizes what she did. She seeks help from her ex-boyfriend, who first waved the
                            whole thing off as a stupid High School rumor, but as weird things start happening, he
                            believes her.<br />When their common child watches the tape as well, they are more motivated
                            than ever to find a solution so they could safe him. They can connect the locations and
                            person shown on the tape with some in real life. While Noah goes to the psychiatric clinic
                            to find out more about Anna, the women on the tape, Rachel goes to the island to speak to
                            Annas husband. They find out, that they had an adopted child together, who brought darkness
                            over the island. As the father of Samora realizes that his daughter's evil is still present,
                            he kills himself. Noah and Rachel manage to uncover the dark secret of the Morgan family,
                            but to their horror that wouldn&rsquo;t stop Samora. She wants to be heard; she will never
                            stop&hellip;</p>
                        <h4>What I think</h4>
                        <p>I watched this movie a long time ago already, but I forgot how good it was. I was hooked
                            throughout the whole movie. The little boy, Aiden, really freaked me out at some parts. It
                            was just such a great plot, with so many questions and secrets that all got answered and
                            uncovered eventually, but they sure had me sitting there questioning a lot of things for the
                            most part. I also have to add, that I really liked the ending. After Rachel was rescued and
                            she was home again, I thought the movie was over; Happy End. So Noah&rsquo;s death really
                            caught me off guard and came out of nowhere. I was already concerned they would leave me
                            without an explanation of why he died, and she didn&rsquo;t, but thankfully, I realized it
                            as soon as Rachel did.</p>
                        <p>A classic that everyone should definitely watch at least once.</p>
