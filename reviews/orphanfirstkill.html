            <h4>About the movie</h4>
            <!--Description + Thoughts-->
            <div>Leena looks like a child but is actually 31 years old. That is because of a condition called
              hypopituitarism, which prevents her body from aging. She is a patient in an Estonian psychiatric clinic.
              One day Leena manages to lure a guard into her cell, and after murdering him, she steals his security card
              to escape. After the escape, she takes on the identity of a 4-year-long missing child from Amerika called
              Esther. Since she looks quite like what Esther would look like now, and considering the parents
              haven&rsquo;t seen their daughter in 4 years, they take her in and don&rsquo;t realize that it isn&rsquo;t
              their daughter who is living in their house. Once a police officer checks if Esther&rsquo;s fingerprints
              from 4 years ago match those from now because he grew suspicion about Leena, he is shocked to find out
              that they don&rsquo;t match at all. Leena is forced to get rid of the police officer, who could blow her
              cover. Little did she know that her &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; knew about her lies, too, and she finds herself
              threatened by her. But since the mother didn&rsquo;t want to hurt her husband with yet another
              disappearance, they worked out an agreement. Leena would go on to pretend to be Esther, and therefore the
              mother wouldn&rsquo;t send her back to the psychiatric clinic. But Leena was not the only one who had to hide
              something&hellip;</div>
            <h4>What I think</h4>
            <p><span>If you are looking for a Psych thriller that will captivate you until the very end, then
                &ldquo;Orphan: First Kill&rdquo; is definitely a great choice. The movie was the opposite of boring; in
                fact, it was so tense and exciting that I wouldn&rsquo;t even pause it for a bathroom-break. The plot
                was amazing. The plot twist even better. The tension never eased at any point, and was accompanied on
                many occasions by scares and creeps.</span></p>
            <p><span>At the beginning of the movie, I was rather alarmed by Leena&rsquo;s behavior, but as the story
                developed and the surprising plot twist came along, the mother showed to be even more creepy. In the
                end, I really felt bad for Ellen, who had no bad feelings but ultimately lost everything.</span></p>
            <p><span>What&rsquo;s more to mention is the amazing acting. Isabelle Fuhrman, as Leena resp. Esther was
                amazing and played the stone-cold character very well.</span></p>
