                        <h4>Tricia Albright, portrayed by Julia Stiles</h4> 
                        The mother of a child that had gone missing. She is a loving and caring person, who still
                        grieves about her lost daughter Esther. But that is all just a facade, a big lie behind which
                        the true Tricia Albright hides. A stone-cold person with no feelings of guilt whatsoever. When
                        her son Gunnar accidentally killed his sister Esther, Tricia didn’t hesitate to cover up the
                        murder and sell it as a missing child case. Throughout the movie Orphan: First kill it gets
                        clear that Tricia does not know any boundaries or limits when it comes to protecting her family.
                        <h4>Why is this my Character of the Month?</h4>
                        Because of the way she acted and pretended to not know who Leena was. I mean sure, she didn’t
                        exactly know who the person pretending to be her daughter was, but she knew that Leena, the
                        person she took into her home and acted as if she’d care about her, wasn't her daughter. It not
                        only caught Leena off guard, but also myself. The way she was so apathetic about the fact that
                        her son killed her daughter and she covered the whole thing up was just amazing. And still, even
                        though she looked like she had no feelings at all, she cared about her husband. Because she did
                        everything just so he wouldn’t find out about the truth.

                        I found her character to be very interesting and also pretty scary.
