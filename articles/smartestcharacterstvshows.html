                        From the TV-Show "Sherlock"
                        <p><span>Sherlock Holmes is a high functioning sociopath working as a Detective. He is the man
                                the police come to, if they are getting stuck on a case. The brilliance of this man has
                                surprised me at least twice in every single episode of the series. From just analyzing a
                                person down to every single detail, to solving the most tangled crime cases ever, this
                                man did it all.</span></p>

                                former student, that ended up being the largest meth operation in American history.
                                Thanks to his scientific knowledge, Walter managed to cook meth that was as pure and
                                highly effective as any other on the market, which is why Jesse Pinkman, his former
                                student and accomplice, and Walter, who turns into a ruthless drug lord known as
                                "Heisenberg", now dominate the meth market.</span></p>

                                those who fit his Code. The code, which has been taught to him by his adoptive father,
                                states to only kill those who have committed a crime and not faced the punishment they
                                deserved. Thanks to his brilliant mind, he manages to not get caught along his murderous
                                adventures.</span></p>
